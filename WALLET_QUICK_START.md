## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Wallet not detected"
**Solution**: Make sure extension is installed and enabled. Refresh page after installation.

### "Connection rejected"
**Solution**: Approve the connection in your wallet popup. Try again if you accidentally rejected.

### "Balance shows 0"
**Solution**: Normal if you have no COREUM. Balance updates automatically when you receive tokens.

### "Doesn't reconnect after refresh"
**Solution**: Wallet might be locked. Unlock your wallet and reconnect manually.
